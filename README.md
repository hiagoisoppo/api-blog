  **:warning: Before you begin, your docker-compose needs to be at version 1.29 or higher. [Look here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-pt) or [in the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) how to install it. In the first article, you can replace where it is with `1.26.0` with `1.29.2`.**

  - Open the terminal and clone the repository.
  ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:hiagoisoppo/api-blog.git
  ```
  - Run the `node` and `db` services.
  ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
  ```
  - Attach to the `container` executed in the previous command.
  ```bash
    docker exec -it blogs_api bash
  ```
  - Install the dependencies inside the container.
  ```bash
    npm install
  ```
  - Start the development server.
  ```bash

## <summary  id="http">:calling: Using HTTP requests to use the API</summary>
  - Access a platform of your choice to make HTTP requests, such as [ThunderClient](https://www.thunderclient.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
  - Import the valid HTTP request file for your platform from the `httpClientFiles` folder.
  - Now you can test this API.
